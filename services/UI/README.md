# infrastructure
``./common/Router.js`` is where the actual logic lives
``./index.js`` is only responsible for referring ``./common/Router.js`` and do the hot-reloading stuff
``./redux/reducers/index.js`` is the entry for all the reducers

# env config
``.env.development`` is where the local variables setting lives
``.env.production`` is where the production variables setting lives(in docker)
the gulp task will load different env files according to the npm command that start it

# (recommanded) install eslint in your editor

# websocket config
``./.env`` is where the socket url lives
## usage:
* once the app start, the socket will be set automatically, and an action will be dispatched like:
```
{
  type: 'SOCKET_OPEN',
}
```

* once a message is arrived the client side, an action will be dispatched with format:
```
{
  type: 'SOCKET_MESSAGE_ARRIVED',
  message,
}
```
and in each saga, use ``takeEvery('SOCKET_MESSAGE_ARRIVED', handler)`` to get the message

* To send a message, dispatched below action:
```
{
  type: 'SOCKET_SEND_MESSSGE',
  message,
}
```

# make file changes hot reload:
In ``index.js``, add file names in:
```
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./common/Router.js', () => {
    hotRender()
  })
  module.hot.accept('./redux/store.js', () => {
    hotRender()
  })
}
```

# the image auto resize component:
this component will automatically create images for different screen resolution, use lazy load and avoid page reflow
config lives in gulp.dev and .env
usage:
```
<ImageContainer
  name={'test.jpg'} />
```

# Router
Router will be automatically generated by gulp task, the route pattern:
```
/${componentName}(/*)?
```
and the match part can be got from ``this.props.match`` in root modules component

# actions, reducers will be import by gulp tasks automatically

## Action type pattern
* Any file creation that path match pattern modules/moduleName/action(s).js or shared/namedAction(s).js will be added to ``configs/gulpGenerated/actions``
* Actions should live in the actions.js file of related business modules or shared folder

## Reducer pattern
* rootReducer will import all reducers, match pattern is same as action, ``configs/gulpGenerated/reducers``
* reducer function should import action type from current folder
* Store object should match the business name(module name), start with lower case and follow camelcase
